A quirky, chaotic reality show where fully simulated characters powered by GPT live, talk, fight, joke, and evolve â€” all without scripts.

Each character has emotions, needs, relationships, and a personality. They interact with each other, react to daily events, and generate raw, unscripted dialogue. Anything can happen.

## How It Works

- Every character has internal state (mood, hunger, energy, etc.) and a personality.
- On each simulation tick, characters:
    - React to others' dialogue.
    - Speak naturally with slang, humor, or dark vibes.
    - Update their stats and relationships.
- GPT is used to simulate thoughts and generate responses.
- Spontaneous events may occur (romance, fights, existential crises... who knows?).
